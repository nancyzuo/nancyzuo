### Hello, I'm Nancy! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a product designer based in California, and I'm interested in designing for _social & learning experiences._ In my free time, I like to get involved with hackathons, side projects, write, annoy my three cats :cat:, and spectate my mom's dragonfruit garden from my room window (I'm working from home this summer). :dragon:

## Currently:

* Content Creator [@ Design Buddies](https://www.designbuddies.community/)
* UX [@ InternHacks](https://internhacks.com/)

Thanks for visiting my profile and stay tuned to see more projects! :seedling:
