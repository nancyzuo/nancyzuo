### Hello, I'm Nancy! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a product designer based in California, and I'm interested in designing for _social and learning experiences._ In my free time, I like to get involved with hackathons, side projects, write, annoy my three cats :cat:, and spectate my mom's dragonfruit garden from my room window. :dragon:

## Currently:

* Content Creator @ [Design Buddies](https://www.designbuddies.community/)

Thanks for visiting my profile and stay tuned to see more projects! :seedling:
