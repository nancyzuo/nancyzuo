### Hello, I'm Nancy! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a product designer based in California, and I'm interested in designing for _social and learning experiences._ In my free time, I like to get involved with hackathons, side projects, write, annoy my three cats :cat:, and spectate my mom's dragonfruit garden from my room window. :dragon:

## Currently:
* Agency Instructional Design Intern @ [State Farm](https://www.statefarm.com/)
* Content Creator @ [Design Buddies](https://www.designbuddies.community/)
* UX @ [InternHacks](https://internhacks.com/)

Thanks for visiting my profile and stay tuned to see more projects! :seedling:
